              Description
This repository contains three JavaScript programs designed to solve different real-world problems:

Student Grade Generator - Determines a student's grade based on input marks.

Speed Detector - Calculates demerit points based on a car's speed.

Net Salary Calculator - Computes an individual's net salary by applying relevant tax and deduction rules.

                                Problem 1: Student Grade Generator

This program prompts the user to enter student marks (ranging from 0 to 100) and assigns a grade based on the following criteria:

Marks Range

Grade

80 - 100

A

60 - 79

B

50 - 59

C

40 - 49

D

Below 40

E

                                               Problem 2: Speed Detector

This program determines whether a driver's speed is within the limit and calculates demerit points for overspeeding. The rules are:

If the speed is 70 km/h or below, it prints "Ok".

If the speed exceeds 70 km/h, the program assigns 1 demerit point for every 5 km/h over the limit.

If a driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, their license is suspended.

                                                Problem 3: Net Salary Calculator

This program calculates an individual's net salary by considering the following:

Gross Salary (Basic Salary + Benefits)

PAYE (Tax Deduction) based on the latest tax brackets.

Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) Contribution (2.75% of gross salary).

NSSF Deduction (6% of pensionable pay, up to the defined limits).

Housing Levy (1.5% of gross salary for both employee and employer contributions).

Final Net Salary after all deductions.
